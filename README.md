nnfsic = Neural Network From Scratch in C

This project is an experiment to understand how neural networks really work. To do this, NNFSIC is made using no neural network or even linear algebra libraries; everything is custom.

If you are looking for efficient or well documented NN libraries, try other projects such as [this one](https://github.com/codeplea/genann).

The results of NNFSIC are a >90% success in the recognition of the MNIST dataset.
